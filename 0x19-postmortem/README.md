## **# Postmortem: The Great Login Apocalypse of 2025**

_(Because every disaster needs a dramatic name)_

## **Issue Summary**
🕒 **Duration:** March 10, 2025, 14:30 - 15:15 UTC (45 minutes)  
🔥 **Impact:** 80% of users were locked out of their accounts, resulting in mass panic, angry tweets, and existential crises. Users with active sessions could still browse but couldn’t log in to make new requests. 
💥 **Root Cause:** A sneaky database configuration update accidentally reduced the connection pool limit, causing the authentication service to collapse like a house of cards.

## **Timeline**
- **14:30 UTC** - Monitoring alert detected an increase in login failures. Cue dramatic music. 🎶
- **14:32 UTC** - Engineers confirmed users were trapped in a login purgatory.
- **14:35 UTC** - Initial theory: The database server went for coffee and never came back.
- **14:40 UTC** - Network team confirmed no connectivity issues. The database server was innocent. 🚀
- **14:45 UTC** - Focus shifted to database performance; everything looked fine, except for a tiny detail: connections were getting maxed out!
- **14:50 UTC** - A wild misconfiguration appeared! 🧐
- **15:00 UTC** - Quick fix applied: increased connection pool size and restarted the servers. Instant magic! ✨
- **15:15 UTC** - System fully recovered. Users rejoiced. Engineers sighed in relief. 🍻

## **Root Cause and Resolution**
### **Root Cause**
Someone (who shall remain unnamed 😏) pushed a configuration update that accidentally reduced the database connection pool from 200 to 50. With the influx of users, the pool dried up faster than free pizza at an office party. 

### **Resolution**
Engineers swiftly restored the connection pool to 200 and restarted the affected services. Boom! Problem solved, chaos averted.

## **Corrective and Preventative Measures**
### **Lessons Learned:**
- Configuration changes should be **double-checked, then checked again** (and maybe once more for luck). 🍀
- Better monitoring of database connections to catch issues before they ruin everyone’s day. 📊
- Implement automated rollbacks so that mistakes don’t linger longer than they should. 🔄

### **Action Items:**
1. **Pre-deployment sanity check:** Ensure database connection limits remain sane.
2. **Upgrade monitoring:** Alert on excessive connection failures.
3. **Automated rollback:** If a config breaks critical services, revert it instantly!
4. **Improve documentation:** So that future engineers don’t suffer the same fate. 

🚀 **Moral of the story:** Tiny misconfigurations can cause massive chaos. Stay vigilant, stay caffeinated. ☕
